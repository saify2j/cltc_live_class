### Install dependencies and integrate the Agora Video SDK


1. Using the Terminal app, enter the `install` command in your project directory. This command installs libraries that are required to run the sample application.
    ``` bash
    # install dependencies
    npm install
    ```
2. Start the application by entering the `run dev` or `run build` command.
    The `run dev` command is for development purposes.
    ``` bash
    # serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
    npm run dev
    ```
    The `run build` command is for production purposes and minifies code.
    ``` bash
    # build for production with minification
    npm run build
    ```
3. Your default browser should open and display the sample application.
    **Note:** In some cases, you may need to open a browser and enter `http://localhost:8080` as the URL.
